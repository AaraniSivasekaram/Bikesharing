# Citi Bikesharing Challenge - Tableau

## Overview:
The purpose of the analysis was to use Tableau to visualize August New York City (NYC) Citi Bike trip data and analyze trip metrics including: peak times of use, duration of bike trips, breakdowns of usage per gender and top start and end times for bike use. This statistical analysis is to inform decision-making for potential use of Citi Bikes for other cities outside of NYC.

## Tableau Link:
Please see tableau story link to checkout the eight data visualizations I have created to narrate the NYC Citi Bike Usage Overview.

## Results:
Several data visualizations were used to analyze the NYC Citi Bike trip data and were included in the Citi Bike Usage Overview (Tableau Story):
1. Gender breakdown - A pie graph indicates more than 60% of Citi Bike usage is from male users.
2. Trip duration data - A line graph reports the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. The data showed most Citi Bikes are used for shorter trips (40 mins or less) with a peak shown at the 6 min duration time. 
3. Trip duration data by gender breakdown - A line graph shows males are using bikes more than other genders, similar to previous line graph shorter trips (40 mins or less) were the most common across all genders. 
4. Heat map of bike trips by hour by day of the week - Data visualization indicates bike usage peaks during commuting hours on weekdays (7-9am and 5-7pm) and during different hours during weekends. Citi Bikes may be a useful mode of transportation for NYC commuters.
5. Heat map of bike trips by hour by day of the week by gender breakdown - Heat maps indicated peak commuting hours during the weekdays and different hours of usage during the weekend remained consistent across all genders. 
6. Heat map of bike trips by user by weekday with a gender breakdown - Data showed number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Male subscribers used Citi Bikes the most compared to other types of users (customers) and genders (female and unknown). 
7. Top starting locations for bike use - Map indicates a cluster of start locations that may correlated with tourist areas and city hubs. 
8. Top ending locations for bike use - Map indicates a cluster of ending locations that may correlated with tourist areas and city hubs. This map mirrors the starting locations map. 

## Summary:
- The analysis indicates the most common use for Citi Bikes are: by males subscribers, for shorter trips (less than 40 minutes, with a peak at 6 minutes), during commuting hours during weekdays and more flexible times during weekends. As well, starting and stopping locations are similarly clustered in central hubs of NYC. 
- If Citi Bikes are being considered in Des Moines, Iowa, they should be piloted in commuting regions and tourist hubs within the city.
- Two additional visualizations that could be included for future analysis include: 
1. Cost per ride for subscribers and customers, and
2. Frequency of accidents overall.
